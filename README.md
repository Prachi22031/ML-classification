Prediction of gender gap in Spanish Wikipedia using machine learning Models.
Here's a brief overview of what the code does:
1.Import necessary libraries, including pandas and numpy.

2.Read data from a CSV file named "data.csv" into a pandas DataFrame.

3.Perform data cleaning by dropping certain columns from the DataFrame.

4.Display basic information about the DataFrame using df.info().

5.Conduct exploratory data analysis by displaying the first few rows, shape, and unique values of each column.

6.Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of values in the 'C_api' column.

7.Plot a correlation heatmap for the DataFrame.

8.Encode textual data in the 'C_api' column to numerical values using label encoding.

9.Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y) variables.

10.Perform train-test split of the data.

11.Build and evaluate several classification models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.

12.Calculate and display accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model.

13.Plot confusion matrices for each model.

14.Visualize the performance of different algorithms using bar plots.
